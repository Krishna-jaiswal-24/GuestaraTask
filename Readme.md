    - `routes`: Contains the routes for the backend
    - `db`: Contains the database connection

### Q&A
- Which database you have chosen and why?
  - I have chosen MongoDB as the database because it is a NoSQL database and is very easy to use with Node.js. It is also very flexible and can store data in JSON format which is very easy to work with.
- What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
    - The difficulty I faced was my end semester exams were going on till 16th May and then I was travelling back to 
      my home city on 17th and !8th May. So I have to manage my time to complete the assignment in the remaining time.

- What you would have done differently given more time?
    - If I had more time I would have added more features to the project like user authentication using jwt tokens, 
      user roles, and permissions, etc. I would have also added more validation to the API endpoints and proper 
      middlewares.
- 3 things that you learned from this assignment?
    -  Mainly I learned about my time management skills and how to manage my time to complete the assignment in the 
       given time frame.
